\usage{
standalone_snapshot(obj, .clip = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{the gold standard to test}

\item{.clip}{copy the result to the clipboard (needs \code{clipr})}
}
\value{
a code snippet that can be pasted into the unit test case
}
\description{
\code{testthat} does not use hash based checking anymore, in favour of snapshots.
These don't work well in tests of standalones because the file will move
projects independently of the test directory. This function lets you quickly
create a check based on a gold standard
